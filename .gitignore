# This file tells Git which files and directories to ignore in your project.
# It's crucial for keeping your repository clean from generated files,
# local configurations, and sensitive data.
#
# For more details, see the official documentation:
# https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore

# --- Virtual Environments ---
# Ignore virtual environment folders. You should share your dependencies
# in a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` file instead.

# --- Secrets and Credentials ---
# Ignore environment variable files.
# It's a best practice to create a `.env.example` file to be committed,
# which documents the required environment variables.
.env

# Ignore other sensitive files like keys and credentials.
# The files you provided from `googleapiclient` are discovery documents,
# not credentials, but it's good practice to ignore credential files.

# Be cautious with config files, only ignore if they contain secrets.
